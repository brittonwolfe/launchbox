#  Launchbox

Launchbox is my first Rust application. I prefer to work from the terminal, so I started launchbox to launch applications from a TUI. And because I want to learn Rust and TUIs are cool.

## What Launchbox Does

Launchbox is a tool launcher that runs in the command line. I previously used something like `run` from my [shell scripts](https://github.com/brittonwolfe/shell-scripts) to put together easy scripts for things like `run build`, `run last`, etc., but wanted to make a TUI application because I think they're cool.
